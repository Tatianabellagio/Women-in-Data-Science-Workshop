The datasets description and the whole analysis are included in the jupyter notebook. 
The idea of the exploration was to get insight about the relationship between gender and people working in areas related to science and techonology in Argentina.

To run the code properly you need to have peviously installed some python libraries: 
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn 
- Plotly 
And there is also some .py files to show your plots in dash (from plotly) so if you want to run them, you will also need dash.

**I hope you enjoy it! 
Do not hesitate in contact me for any question!
